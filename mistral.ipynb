I think the best thing for me to do in San Francisco is to write about the evolution of technology and its impact on income inequality. I've long been interested in this subject, and I believe I can make a valuable contribution through essays and research. I've also found that being in San Francisco, with its vibrant startup scene and high concentration of technical innovation, provides an ideal setting for this work. In particular, I plan to focus on the exponential impact of technology on productivity and its corresponding effects on income. I've seen the advantages of this approach firsthand, having attended Hacker News and read about the latest developments and conversations in the industry. However, it's important to note that my findings and thoughts on this topic, especially their implications for income inequality, are not universally accepted. As such, I plan to devote considerable time to developing my ideas and engaging with critical voices and scholars in the field. It's also essential that I continue to refine my arguments and evidence through rigorous research and experiments, and ensure their validity and originality. Ultimately, I believe this research will not only contribute to a better understanding of the complex relationship between technology's effects on income, but provide valuable insights for both the academic and practical communities.\n",

This is because San Francisco was one of the few places where it was possible to create wealth rapidly and cheaply, through the creation of new software products or websites.

This is the principle that has turned on and off the prospect of keeping it in various times and places in history. In San Francisco, as in most places, if you suppress variations in income, whether by stealing private fortunes or taxing them away, the result always seems to be the same: society as a whole ends up poorer. I'd like to propose an alternative idea: that in a modern society, increasing variation in income is a sign of health. Technology seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates. If you don't see corresponding variation in income, there are three possible explanations: (a) that technical innovation has stopped; (b) that the people who would create the most wealth aren't doing it; or (c) that they aren't getting paid for it. I think we can safely say that (a) and (b) would be bad. If you had a choice of living in a society where you were materially much better off than you are now, but were among the poorest, or in one where you were the richest, but much worse off than you are now, you'd take the first option.
